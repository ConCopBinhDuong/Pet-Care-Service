# Service Reports System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Service Reports System has been successfully implemented to allow pet owners to report issues with services they have received. This system provides comprehensive functionality for creating, managing, and analyzing service reports.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
The system utilizes the existing `service_report` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE service_report (
    bookid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    text TEXT,
    image BLOB,
    FOREIGN KEY(bookid) REFERENCES booking(bookid) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Key Relationships
- **One-to-One**: Each booking can have at most one service report
- **Report to Booking**: `service_report.bookid` → `booking.bookid`
- **Booking to Service**: `booking.svid` → `service.serviceid`
- **Booking to Pet Owner**: `booking.poid` → `petowner.id`
- **Service to Provider**: `service.providerid` → `serviceprovider.id`

## API Endpoints

## Security Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Pet Owners**: Can only create, view, update, and delete their own reports
- **Service Providers**: Can view reports for their services only
- **Managers**: Can view all reports and system-wide analytics

### Ownership Verification
- All operations verify that users can only access their own data
- Booking ownership checked before report creation/modification
- Service ownership verified for provider access

### Business Logic Enforcement
- Reports can only be created for past or current services
- Duplicate reports prevented at database level
- Comprehensive input validation with detailed error messages

## Validation Middleware

### validateReportCreation
- Text: Required, 1-2000 characters
- Image: Optional, must be valid base64 data URL or HTTP URL

### validateReportUpdate  
- At least one field required for update
- Same validation rules as creation for provided fields

## Integration Status

### ✅ Completed Components
1. **Route Handler** (`/src/routes/reports.js`)
   - 8 comprehensive endpoints
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Role-based access control
   - Error handling and validation

2. **Validation Middleware** (`/src/middleware/validationMiddleware.js`)
   - `validateReportCreation` function
   - `validateReportUpdate` function
   - Comprehensive input validation

3. **Server Integration** (`/src/server.js`)
   - Reports routes imported and registered
   - Proper middleware chain applied
   - Authentication and verification required

4. **Database Integration**
   - Leverages existing `service_report` table
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - ACID transaction support

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **`test_reports_api.rest`** - Manual API testing with 20 test cases
2. **`test_reports_integration.js`** - Node.js integration test suite
3. **`test_reports_quick.js`** - Quick server and endpoint verification

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Report CRUD operations
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ✅ Input validation  
- ✅ Business logic enforcement
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Duplicate prevention
- ✅ Ownership verification

## Usage Examples

### Create a Report
```javascript
POST /api/reports/booking/123
Authorization: Bearer <pet_owner_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Service was incomplete and unprofessional",
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."
}
```

### View Provider Reports
```javascript
GET /api/reports/provider/456
Authorization: Bearer <provider_token>

Response:
{
  "message": "Provider reports retrieved successfully",
  "provider": {
    "id": 456,
    "businessName": "Pet Paradise",
    "contactName": "John Smith"
  },
  "statistics": {
    "totalReports": 3,
    "serviceBreakdown": [...]
  },
  "reports": [...]
}
```
