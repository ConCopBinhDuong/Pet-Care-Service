   - `svid` - Service ID (Foreign key to service.serviceid)
   - `slot` - Time slot for the appointment
   - `servedate` - Date of service
   - `status` - Appointment status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
   - `payment_method` - Payment method used

2. **`schedule`** - General schedule entries

### New Files
- `src/routes/scheduleDashboard.js` - New comprehensive schedule dashboard endpoints
- `test_schedule_dashboard_endpoints.rest` - Complete API test suite
- `verify_schedule_dashboard.js` - Implementation verification script

- **Manager**: No access to schedule dashboards (focused on service review)

### Authentication Middleware
- All endpoints require valid JWT token via `authMiddleware`
- Role validation on every request
- User-specific data filtering (users can only see their own data)

### Data Privacy
- Strict separation between pet owner and service provider data
- No cross-role data access
- User ID validation on all database queries

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Responses
- **403 Forbidden**: Role-based access violations
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters or data validation failures
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server errors

### Input Validation
- Date format validation
- Required field validation
- Parameter type checking
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements

## Testing

### Test File Coverage
- **35 comprehensive test cases** in `test_schedule_dashboard_endpoints.rest`
- **Authorization testing**: Role-based access control verification
- **Error handling**: Invalid input and unauthorized access tests
- **Edge cases**: Empty results, invalid dates, large date ranges
- **Functional verification**: Data structure and content validation

### Test Categories
1. **Pet Owner Endpoints** (7 tests)
2. **Service Provider Endpoints** (7 tests)
3. **General Schedule Management** (5 tests)
4. **Authorization and Error Handling** (6 tests)
5. **Edge Cases and Validation** (5 tests)
6. **Performance and Load Tests** (2 tests)
7. **Functional Verification** (3 tests)

## Database Queries

### Optimized Query Design
- **Multi-table Joins**: Efficiently combines booking, service, provider, and user data
- **Indexed Lookups**: Uses primary keys and foreign keys for fast retrieval
- **Prepared Statements**: Prevents SQL injection and improves performance
- **Selective Data Retrieval**: Only fetches required columns

### Query Performance Considerations
- **Date Range Filtering**: Uses indexed date columns for efficient filtering
- **User-Specific Queries**: Filters by user ID at the database level
- **Aggregate Statistics**: Calculated in application layer for flexibility

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Caching Layer**: Redis caching for frequently accessed schedules
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live schedule updates
3. **Export Functionality**: PDF/CSV export of schedule data
4. **Mobile API**: Optimized endpoints for mobile applications
5. **Calendar Integration**: iCal/Google Calendar synchronization
6. **Notification System**: Automated appointment reminders
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Advanced reporting and insights

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Database Indexing**: Additional indexes on frequently queried columns
2. **Query Optimization**: More efficient SQL queries for large datasets
3. **Pagination**: Support for large result sets
4. **Background Processing**: Async processing for heavy operations
