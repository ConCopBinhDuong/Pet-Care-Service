# Verification-First Registration System Documentation

## Overview

The Pet Care Service backend has been upgraded with a **verification-first registration system** that requires users to verify both their email AND phone number before an account is created. This ensures only fully verified users can access the platform.

## Key Changes

### 🔒 Security Enhancement
- **No account creation until full verification**: Users must complete both email and phone verification before any account is created in the database
- **Login prevention**: Users with incomplete verification cannot log in
- **Session-based temporary storage**: Registration data is stored temporarily during the verification process

### 🔄 New Registration Flow

#### Old Flow (Deprecated but still available)
```
1. POST /register → Account created immediately with verification flags set to false
2. User can login even without verification
3. Optional email/phone verification later
```

#### New Flow (Recommended)
```
1. POST /start-verification → No account created, verification codes sent
2. POST /verify-registration-email → Email verification step
3. POST /verify-registration-phone → Phone verification step  
4. POST /complete-registration → Account created with full verification
5. POST /login → Login allowed (only for fully verified accounts)
```

## API Endpoints

Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer jwt-token

{
    "userId": 123

```

## Technical Implementation

### Services

#### preVerificationService.js
- **Purpose**: Manages temporary registration data during verification process
- **Features**: 
  - Session-based storage with 30-minute expiration
  - Verification step tracking
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
  - Thread-safe operations

#### Key Methods:
- `createPendingRegistration(data)` - Creates new verification session
- `getPendingRegistration(sessionId)` - Retrieves session data
- `markEmailVerified(sessionId)` - Marks email as verified
- `markPhoneVerified(sessionId)` - Marks phone as verified
- `getVerificationStatus(sessionId)` - Gets current verification status
- `cleanupExpiredSessions()` - Removes expired sessions

### Middleware

#### Enhanced validationMiddleware.js
New validation functions:
- `validatePreVerificationRegistration` - Validates initial registration data
- `validateVerificationSession` - Validates session ID format
- `validateEmailVerificationStep` - Validates email verification step
- `validatePhoneVerificationStep` - Validates phone verification step
- `validateCompleteRegistration` - Validates final registration completion

### Database Changes

#### Users Table
- Accounts are only created with `email_verified = 1` and `phone_verified = 1`
- No incomplete accounts exist in the database
- All registered users can login (they've completed full verification)

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Incomplete Users

If you have existing users with incomplete verification:

1. **Check incomplete registrations:**
   ```http
   GET /api/auth/admin/incomplete-registrations
   ```

2. **For each incomplete user, either:**
   - **Option A**: Force complete verification (Admin)
     ```http
     POST /api/auth/admin/force-complete-verification
     {"userId": 123}
     ```
   
   - **Option B**: Let users restart verification
     ```http
     POST /api/auth/restart-verification
     {"username": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}
     ```

### Backward Compatibility

- Old `/register` endpoint still works but is marked as deprecated
- Users created via old endpoint cannot login until verification is completed
- Use `/restart-verification` to help existing users complete verification

## Security Features

### Session Security
- **UUID-based session IDs**: Cryptographically secure session identification
- **Time-based expiration**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired sessions are automatically removed
- **No sensitive data exposure**: Session IDs don't reveal user information

### Verification Security
- **Double verification**: Both email AND phone must be verified
- **Code-based verification**: 6-digit codes for both email and phone
- **Anti-bypass**: Cannot skip verification steps or create accounts without full verification
- **Rate limiting**: Inherits from existing rate limiting middleware

### Login Security
- **Verification enforcement**: Login blocked until full verification
- **Clear error messages**: Users understand what verification is missing
- **JWT blacklist support**: Maintains existing token blacklist functionality

## Testing

### Test Files
- `test_verification_registration.rest` - Comprehensive REST API tests
- `test_verification_system.js` - Node.js unit tests for service layer

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete successful registration flow**
2. **Partial verification attempts**
3. **Session expiration handling**
4. **Login prevention for unverified users**
5. **Admin management features**
6. **Error cases and edge conditions**

## Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Verification session creation/completion
- Failed login attempts due to incomplete verification
- Session cleanup operations
- Admin force-completion actions

### Metrics to Track
- Registration completion rate
- Time from start-verification to completion
- Number of incomplete registrations
- Verification code success rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Users can't receive verification codes**
   - Check email service configuration
   - Verify phone service setup
   - Check logs for service errors

2. **Sessions expiring too quickly**
   - Current expiration: 30 minutes
   - Modify `SESSION_EXPIRATION_MS` in preVerificationService.js

3. **Existing users can't login**
   - Use `/check-verification-status` to diagnose
   - Use `/restart-verification` to help users complete verification
   - Admin can use `/admin/force-complete-verification` as last resort

### Error Codes
- `400` - Validation errors, duplicate email, invalid session
- `401` - Invalid credentials
- `403` - Verification required, admin access denied
- `404` - User not found, session not found
- `500` - Internal server errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** using the provided test files
2. **Configure email/phone services** for production
3. **Monitor registration metrics** to ensure smooth user experience
4. **Update frontend** to use new verification-first flow
5. **Train support team** on new verification process
